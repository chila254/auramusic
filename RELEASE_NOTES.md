# AuraMusic v1.0.9 (Build 10) Release Notes

## What's New in This Update

### Video Player Overhaul
This release brings a complete refresh of the video player experience with YouTube-inspired design and smooth animations:

8. **Brightness/Volume Swipe Gestures**
   - Swipe left side of video to adjust brightness
   - Swipe right side to adjust volume
   - Vertical indicator with progress bar and percentage display

### Music Video Improvements
- **Regular songs now fetch music videos automatically** - Enable video mode for any song
- **Known limitation**: Some songs might show other videos that are not the exact song video. We are actively working on improving matching accuracy.

- **Improved video search matching** - Better filtering and scoring to find official music videos

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
