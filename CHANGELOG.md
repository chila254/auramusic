# AuraMusic v1.0.8 (Build 9) Changelog

## New Features

### Video Mode - Official Music Video Search

- Prioritizes official music videos, Vevo, "MV" tagged videos, and videos containing the song title
- Falls back to the first search result if no preferred match is found
- Enabled by default for new installations
- Marked as "Experimental" in Settings

### Video Mode UI Improvements

- Better error handling with user-friendly toast messages when video is unavailable
- Improved black screen issue - video mode now properly falls back to audio on error
- Fixed video playback detection for better stream selection

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed compile errors related to duplicate video result handling

# AuraMusic v1.0.7 (Build 8) Changelog

## New Features

### AuraMusic Branding Update
- Updated all internal references from the previous branding to AuraMusic
- Changed "It seems like you found [previous app name] recently..." to "It seems like you found AuraMusic recently..." in WrappedData.kt

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed % Display Issues in Wrapped**: Resolved an issue where percentage symbols were displaying literally instead of actual numbers in wrapped statistics screens:
  - WrappedTotalSongsScreen.kt - Added missing uniqueSongCount parameter to stringResource()
  - WrappedTotalArtistsScreen.kt - Added missing uniqueArtistCount parameter to stringResource()
  - AlbumPages.kt - Added missing uniqueAlbumCount parameter to stringResource()

- **Fixed Total Songs Not Showing in Wrapped Playlist**: Resolved an issue where the wrapped playlist was showing incorrect or zero song count. The root cause was a date mismatch between the playlist creation (hardcoded year from WrappedConstants.YEAR) and the dynamic date range used in data preparation:
  - Updated createPlaylist() method in WrappedManager.kt to use the same dynamic date range as the prepare() method
  - Updated generatePlaylistMap() method in WrappedManager.kt to use the same dynamic date range
